## Important information

**Created static web with React according to e-mail information**

> Only static layout needed.

- Hope, I understand it properly - use React hooks in minimum, change
  on web was implement only by using CSS.

#### Information about coding

- Hard to know what UI/UX designer idea was but made it with my sense
  of beauty

    - semantic tags are used but hard to know which tag will be better
      due to latin "Lorem" text,
    - links are made without gatsby.js external links due to weak
      knowledge of framework,

- Mobile version works properly only on width 414px,
- Not all is made like I wanted to due to lack of experience and time,
- Solving problems have been done by [Google](https://www.google.pl/)
  and [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), but destroy a lot
  of my time for coding,
- Lack of experience and the related need to look for solutions is the
  main reason for the poor level of task performance.
